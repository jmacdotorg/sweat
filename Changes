    - Adding a simple interactive mode.

    - Adding a "refocus" option that will attempt to refocus back to the window Sweat is running in after it opens a browser window.

    - Wikipedia articles now load in the background during the workout, rather than forcing a pre-workout wait while they all finish loading.

    - Improved CPAN distribution abstract (Thanks to Toby Inkster for the suggestion)

    - Changes to Wikipedia mode:
    
        - Avoiding repeating any article during a single workout
        
        - Avoiding articles with certain keywords in the title that suggest primarily non-prose content (e.g. "List of" or "Comparison of")

        - Dropping parentheticals (e.g. birth and death dates, original-language spellings, and IPA pronunciations) from Wikipedia articles' summaries, because they often do not read out loud well.

    - Fixing a bug that would ignore "no-news" in a config file.
    
    - Fixed incorrect docs and sample-config info (Thanks to Tim Vroom)

    - Adding a "language" config option for setting Wikipedia localization.
    
    - Declining to follow links to Wikipedia articles with numerals in the title, in an effort to avoid boring chains of annual-statistics pages.

    - Configuring the internal MediaWiki::API object to automatically retry a few times if any response from the wiki takes more than a couple of seconds.

    - Making use of File::Which, rather than assuming the presence of a `command` command. (Thanks to Kivanc Yazan for pointing this problem out.)

201909170 2019-09-18T01:05:29Z

    - Adding LWP::Protocol::https as a dependency.

201909090 2019-09-09T21:32:31Z

    - Replacing the LICENSE file with an MIT license, as originally intended

    - Small organizational improvements for CPAN's sake; thanks to Dan Book for the suggestions.
