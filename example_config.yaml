# Sweat: Example configuration file
#
# Make a copy of this file and then update that copy to taste.
#
# If you name the file ".sweat" and put it in your home directory, then
# Sweat will load it automatically. Otherwise you can specify it with Sweat's
# "-c" command-line flag.
#
# (Note that a config file isn't *technically* required; you can try running
# Sweat using only its defaults, but it's likely to complain about something.)

# DRILL DEFINITION
##################
#
# If you don't define any drills here, Sweat will set you up with the twelve
# "seven-minute workout" drills. This may very well be what you want.
# If you define any drills here, then Sweat will use *only* these drills.
# Drills are arranged into groups, and have attributes about their requirements.
# Let's go ahead and just define the 12 7-minute drills anyway. Yay redundancy!
# (Actually, I suppose you could hand-localize these drill names into a language
# besides English if you wanted to, huh.)
